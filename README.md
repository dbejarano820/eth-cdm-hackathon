# Paymeez
A merchant friendly solution for in person crypto payments. It abstracts the logic and facilitates receiving payments in cyptocurrencies without previous knowledge. Paymeez allows merchants to embrace and open the doors for clients that prefer to pay with crypto and whom rather not connect their wallets to sketchy websites.

Paymeez allows the merchant to automatically generate additional yield on the capital they receive through the platform. It's a blockchain agnostic solution, with the first supported network being Avalanche.
